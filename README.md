This is a small pre-screening exercise for Java candidates before a phone conversation with one of the engineers
will be given. Following are the instructions to be sent to the candidates. Note that it is important to tell the
candidate beforehand that they will need an immediate block of 30 minutes to complete the exercise, and that it
will be advantageous to work on a computer with some standard Java development tools (specifically [maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)).

The attached project contains a small, incomplete implementation of functions as first order objects in Java.
Within the project is a JUnit test suite (`src/test/java/com/novus/fp/FunctionTest.java`) that tests two properties
of functions: 1) application and 2) composition.

Your goal is to implement the functions and, where necessary, complete the base representation of functions such
that the tests pass. When the tests pass, zip up your code and send it to us.

The tests can be run through [maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) via the usual `mvn test`, or you can run them through
Eclipse or Idea if you so desire. The choice is up to you, but time is of the essence.

You have 30 minutes. Good luck!
