The attached project contains a small, incomplete implementation of functions as first order objects in Java.
Within the project is a JUnit test suite (`src/test/java/com/novus/fp/FunctionTest.java`) that tests two properties
of functions: 1) application and 2) composition.

Your goal is to implement the functions and, where necessary, complete the base representation of functions such
that the tests pass. When the tests pass, zip up your code and send it to us.

The tests can be run through [maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) via the usual `mvn test`, or you can run them through
Eclipse or Idea if you so desire. The choice is up to you, but time is of the essence.

You have 30 minutes. Good luck!
